# Cursor Rules for MtgLeague Project

## CRITICAL: Working Directory
- ALWAYS work in the `mtgleague/` subdirectory for all development
- The Next.js app is located in `mtgleague/src/`
- All npm commands must be run from `mtgleague/` directory
- All file paths should be relative to `mtgleague/` when working with the app

## Project Structure
- Root level: Project documentation and planning files
- `mtgleague/`: The actual Next.js application
  - `mtgleague/src/`: Source code
  - `mtgleague/package.json`: Dependencies
  - `mtgleague/node_modules/`: Installed packages
- `migrations/`: Database migrations (root level)
  - Numbered sequentially: `001-initial-schema.sql`, `002-feature-name.sql`, etc.

## Development Guidelines
- When installing packages: `cd mtgleague && npm install <package>`
- When creating new files: Always place them in `mtgleague/src/`
- When editing existing files: Ensure they're in `mtgleague/src/`
- When running commands: Always run from `mtgleague/` directory

## Migration Guidelines
- ALWAYS create migrations in `/migrations/` folder (root level)
- Number migrations sequentially: `001-`, `002-`, `003-`, etc.
- Use descriptive names: `001-initial-schema.sql`, `002-user-management.sql`
- Each migration should be self-contained and runnable
- Include clear comments explaining what each migration does
- Test migrations in development before applying to production

## Database Transaction Rules
- **CRITICAL**: Any operation requiring multiple database inserts/updates MUST use transactions
- For complex multi-step operations, create Supabase RPC functions in migrations
- NEVER use multiple separate database calls for related operations
- Always implement atomic operations that either succeed completely or rollback entirely
- Use the pattern established in `migrations/010-add-leg-results-transaction.sql` as a template
- Example: Leg results saving, user creation with invites, season management with legs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Installing packages at root level
- ❌ Creating files outside `mtgleague/src/`
- ❌ Running npm commands from root directory
- ❌ Creating migrations outside `/migrations/` folder
- ❌ Using non-sequential migration numbers
- ❌ Multiple separate database calls for related operations
- ❌ Not using transactions for multi-step operations
- ✅ Always work within `mtgleague/` subdirectory
- ✅ Always use `/migrations/` for database changes
- ✅ Always use transactions for multi-step database operations

## File Organization
- `docs/`: Project documentation, PRDs, setup guides
- `migrations/`: Database migrations (sequentially numbered)
- `mtgleague/src/app/`: Next.js app router pages
- `mtgleague/src/components/`: React components
- `mtgleague/src/lib/`: Utility functions and configurations
