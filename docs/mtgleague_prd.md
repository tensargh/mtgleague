# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview 

**Example:**
Build a web application to manage Magic: The Gathering league events, including match tracking, and leaderboard management.
We'll be able to have leagues from multiple stores running concurrently.

## Objectives & Goals
- We can set up stores and manage TOs for those stores
- TOs can create a Season. The normal amount of Legs in a League is 10, with the top 7 Leg results counting. A Tournament Organiser can choose a number of Legs greater than 10.
- TOs can create a leg within a Season and list players from existing players at their store or add new players.
- Each Leg will be a Swiss event, with the number of matches appropriate for the number of players. Players will score 3 point for each win and 1 point for each draw or tie.
- At the end of a Leg a TO can enter the results easily.
- Once the results are completed for a Leg the season standings will be available.
- A Tournament Organiser can make their Top 8 at any time after Leg 10. When they make their Top 8 they will be asked to specify the number of best Legs to take. The default and minimum will be 7.
- Once the Top 8 is determined, they will play a single elimination knockout tournament to determine the League champion.
